The suggestion that it is related by umlaut to brood and breed is rejected by OED as \"quite inadmissible.\" Metathesis of -r- and -i- was complete 15c.  Middle English, in which bird referred to various young animals and even human beings, may have preserved the original meaning of this word. Despite its early attestation, bridd is not necessarily the oldest form of bird. It is usually assumed that -ir- from -ri- arose by metathesis, but here, too, the Middle English form may go back to an ancient period. [Liberman]  Figurative sense of \"secret source of information\" is from 1540s. Bird dog (n.) attested from 1832, a gun dog used in hunting game birds; hence the verb (1941) meaning \"to follow closely.\" Bird-watching attested from 1897. Bird\u0027s-eye view is from 1762.

{"spell":"conservative","phonetic":"kənˈsə:vətiv","etymology":"late 14c., conservatyf, from M.Fr. conservatif, from L.L. conservativus, from L. conservatus, pp. of conservare (see conserve). As a modern political tradition, conservatism traces to Edmund Burke\u0027s opposition to the French Revolution (1790), but the word conservative is not found in his writing. It was coined by his French disciples, (e.g. Chateaubriand, who titled his journal defending clerical and political restoration \"Le Conservateur\"). Conservative as the name of a British political faction first appeared in an 1830 issue of the \"Quarterly Review,\" in an unsigned article sometimes attributed to John Wilson Croker. It replaced Tory (q.v.) by 1843, reflecting both a change from the pejorative name (in use for 150 years) and repudiation of some reactionary policies. Extended to similar spirits in other parties from 1845.Strictly speaking, conservatism is not a political system, but rather a way of looking at the civil order. The conservative of Peru ... will differ greatly from those of Australia, for though they may share a preference for things established, the institutions and customs which they desire to preserve are not identical.

Before mechanization, cotton picking was the most difficult labor on a cotton plantation.  I drove out to a number of the farms near Denison and found many very young white children working all day in the hot sun picking and dragging sacks of cotton. In one field the labor corps consisted of one woman and six children, one of them 5 years, one 6 years, one 7 years, one 9 years, and two about 11. The father was plowing. The 5 and 6 year olds worked all day as did the rest. The 7-year-old said he picked 50 pounds a day and the 9 year old 75 pounds. (A good picker averages several hundred a day.) School begins late on account of the cotton picking, but the children nearly all prefer school to the picking. Picking hours are long, hot, and deadly monotonous. While the very young children seem to enjoy it, very soon their distaste for it grows into all-absorbing hatred for all work. [\"Field Notes of Lewis W.

{"spell":"gay","phonetic":"ɡei","etymology":"late 14c., \"full of joy, merry; light-hearted, carefree;\" also \"wanton, lewd, lascivious\" (late 12c. as a surname, Philippus de Gay), from O.Fr. gai \"joyful, happy; pleasant, agreeably charming; forward, pert\" (12c.; cf. O.Sp. gayo, Port. gaio, It. gajo, probably French loan-words). Ultimate origin disputed; perhaps from Frankish *gahi (cf. O.H.G. wahi \"pretty\"), though not all etymologists accept this. Meaning \"stately and beautiful; splendid and showily dressed\" is from early 14c. The word gay by the 1890s had an overall tinge of promiscuity -- a gay house was a brothel. The suggestion of immorality in the word can be traced back at least to the 1630s, if not to Chaucer:  But in oure bed he was so fressh and gay Whan that he wolde han my bele chose.  Slang meaning \"homosexual\" (adj.) begins to appear in psychological writing late 1940s, evidently picked up from gay slang and not always easily distinguished from the older sense:  After discharge A.Z. lived for some time at home. He was not happy at the farm and went to a Western city where he associated with a homosexual crowd, being \"gay,\" and wearing female clothes and makeup. He always wished others would make advances to him. [\"Rorschach Research Exchange and Journal of Projective Techniques,\" 1947, p.240]  The association with (male) homosexuality likely got a boost from the term gay cat, used as far back as 1893 in Amer.Eng. for \"young hobo,\" one who is new on the road, also one who sometimes does jobs.  \"A Gay Cat,\" said he, \"is a loafing laborer, who works maybe a week, gets his wages and vagabonds about hunting for another \u0027pick and shovel\u0027 job. Do you want to know where they got their monica (nickname) \u0027Gay Cat\u0027? See, Kid, cats sneak about and scratch immediately after chumming with you and then get gay (fresh). That\u0027s why we call them \u0027Gay Cats\u0027.\" [Leon Ray Livingston (\"America\u0027s Most Celebrated Tramp\"), \"Life and Adventures of A-no. 1,\" 1910]  Quoting a tramp named Frenchy, who might not have known the origin. Gay cats were severely and cruelly abused by \"real\" tramps and bums, who considered them \"an inferior order of beings who begs of and otherwise preys upon the bum -- as it were a jackal following up the king of beasts\" [Prof. John J. McCook, \"Tramps,\" in \"The Public Treatment of Pauperism,\" 1893], but some accounts report certain older tramps would dominate a gay cat and employ him as a sort of slave. In \"Sociology and Social Research\" (1932-33) a paragraph on the \"gay cat\" phenomenon notes, \"Homosexual practices are more common than rare in this group,\" and gey cat \"homosexual boy\" is attested in N. Erskine\u0027s 1933 dictionary of \"Underworld \u0026 Prison Slang\" (gey is a Scottish variant of gay).  The \"Dictionary of American Slang\" reports that gay (adj.) was used by homosexuals, among themselves, in this sense since at least 1920. Rawson [\"Wicked Words\"] notes a male prostitute using gay in reference to male homosexuals (but also to female prostitutes) in London\u0027s notorious Cleveland Street Scandal of 1889. Ayto [\"20th Century Words\"] calls attention to the ambiguous use of the word in the 1868 song \"The Gay Young Clerk in the Dry Goods Store,\" by U.S. female impersonator Will S. Hays, but the word evidently was not popularly felt in this sense by wider society until the 1950s at the earliest.  \"Gay\" (or \"gai\") is now widely used in French, Dutch, Danish, Japanese, Swedish, and Catalan with the same sense as the English. It is coming into use in Germany and among the English-speaking upper classes of many cosmopolitan areas in other countries. [John Boswell, \"Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality,\" 1980]  Gay as a noun meaning \"a (usually male) homosexual\" is attested from 1971; in M.E. it meant \"excellent person, noble lady, gallant knight,\" also \"something gay or bright; an ornament or badge\" (c.1400).","type":2,"summary":"明亮的","audioLink":"http://res.iciba.com/resource/amp3/0/0/6e/11/6e11873b9d9d94a44058bef5747735ce.mp3"}

Early 16c. Portuguese traders carried the crop to all their shipping ports and the sweet potato was quickly adopted from Africa to India and Java. The name later (1590s) was extended to the common white potato, from Peru, which was at first (mistakenly) called Virginia potato, or, because at first it was of minor importance compared to the sweet potato, bastard potato. Spanish invaders in Peru began to use white potatoes as cheap food for sailors 1530s.
